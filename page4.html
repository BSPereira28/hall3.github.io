  <p>If I am not mistaken, not every hall has a gym, and as Hall 3 is reknowned as a Sports Hall, it is useful to have a gym for the sportsmen to build strength.</p>
  <p>The gym is relatively small, only allowing up to 4 pax at one time.</p>
  <p>That being said, there should be enough equipment to get in a decent workout. </p>
